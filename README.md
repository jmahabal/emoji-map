# An Emoji Map of San Francisco and the East Bay

We use mental maps everyday, guiding our journey across space. We associate places with memories. Locations are not just physical but also emotional. As you explore the map you'll recognize places but other times a plot of land might not be familiar. This resulting quilt was a labor of love, but also one where I realized just how little I knew of where I decided to call home.
